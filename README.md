# Design-Thinking
We introduce an idea for a smart trolley solution to improve the shopping experience by addressing issues with traditional barcode scanning at checkout counters. The proposed system uses sensors in shopping trolleys for automatic, real-time barcode scanning when products are placed in the trolley to replace the existing cash counters by moving towards a more economic and time saving retail system.
This innovative approach optimizes the retail 
experience by integrating cutting-edge technology directly into the shopping journey. At the heart of the system is a thoughtfully designed shopping trolley that serves as the core for integrating essential components. Our solution is a cashier less system that utilizes a mobile app, allowing customers to effortlessly scan items using QR codes and complete purchases.
